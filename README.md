# Full-Stack-Calculator-on-Terminal
# Python Calculator with File Storage

This is a Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The unique feature of this calculator is that it allows users to save the results of calculations to a file. The user can specify the file name and extension (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, etc.) to store the calculation results.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Save the results of calculations to a user-specified file.
- Supports custom file names and extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.log`, `.csv`).
- Simple command-line interface that interacts with the user.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project folder:

3. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

## Usage

1. Run the calculator script:

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
    - Enter two numbers for calculation.
    - Choose the arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
    - See the result of the operation.
    
3. After the calculation:
    - You will be prompted to decide whether to continue with another calculation or not.
    - If you choose to exit, you will be asked if you want to save the result.
    - If you choose "yes," you will be prompted to enter a filename with an extension (e.g., `result.txt`).

4. The result will be saved in the file you specify, and you will see a message confirming that the result has been saved.

## Example Usage

Welcome to db calculator...... Enter 1st number : 5 Enter 2nd number : 3

NOTE

For Sum enter : +
For Sub enter : -
For Mul enter : *
For Div enter : /
Enter your Input : + 5 + 3 = 8 Do you want to continue? (yes/no): no Do you want to save the output? (yes/no): yes Enter the file name to store with extension (ex.: Name.txt): result.txt Result saved in result.txt


## How it works

1. The user enters two numbers.
2. The user chooses an arithmetic operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
3. The calculator performs the operation and displays the result.
4. The user can save the result to a file by providing a filename with an extension. The result is saved in the file in a readable format.
5. The program then exits or continues based on the user's input.
